======== I have the "make" commend ========
===========================================

If your device supports the "make" command, this will be much easier (because my file name is very long...).
You can type "make" in Terminal to see the output of all Python files directly.
You can also type in :
>>>make q2
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 2

>>>make q3
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 3

>>>make q5
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 5

>>>make q6
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 6

>>>make q8
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 8

============================================
===== I do not have the "make" commend =====
============================================

If there is no "make" command, you have to enter it one by one :
>>>python HW_1_CylinderVolume_OneNeuron_Sigmoid.py
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 2

>>>python HW_1_CylinderVolume_OneNeuron_Tanh.py
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 3

>>>python HW_1_CylinderVolume_TwoNeurons_Sigmoid.py
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 5

>>>python HW_1_CylinderVolume_TwoNeurons_Tanh.py
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 6

>>>python HW_1_CylinderVolume_ThreeNeurons_Sigmoid.py
// Output the execution result of hw1 question 8
